        <h2>Where would you go?</h2>
        <p>
            If I could take a vacation right now, I would go to Bengaluru, a city in India. 
            Though it is mostly known for its traffic, there’s a lot more to the city. 
            It has peaceful lakes, and the early morning sunrises are serene with a cup of tea. 
            My bucket list would have a lot of things, from calm walks to shopping around the city. 
            I would start my morning with a peaceful walk around Cubbon Park. 
            I will then hit the Bannerghatta Biological Zoo. 
            I would love to catch up with my old friends and shop around in one of the famous malls like the Phoenix Market City.

        <h2>What would you do?</h2>
        <p>
            My itinerary would include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Visit the Chinnasamy Stadium where a lot of famous cricket matches take place.</li>
            <li>Spend time at Wonderla, a water park, with friends to have fun.</li>
            <li>Hit the prime shopping spots like Commercial Street and Brigade Road.</li>
            <li>Go to Pyramid Valley International, a meditation center with vast gardens and libraries.</li>
            <li>Visit the Mysore Palace; the place is magical at night with all the lights lit up.</li>
            <li>Participate in the ‘Thindi Walk’ to try out local food spots.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What would you eat?</h2>
        <p>
            My trip to Bengaluru is going to be all about food. 
            I would start with the very famous Masala Dosa and a cup of tea from the Rameshwaram Cafe. 
            Then, I would have the classic BisiBeleBath, a Bengaluru staple. 
            I would love to try the Hoskote Mutton Biriyani that is made fresh every morning. 
            And of course, I’d end the day with a steaming cup of filter coffee.
